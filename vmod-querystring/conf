LONG_DESC=$( cat << EOF
The purpose of this module is to give you a fine-grained control over a URL's
 query-string in Varnish Cache. It's possible to remove the query-string, clean
 it, sort its parameters or filter it to only keep a subset of them.
 This can greatly improve your hit ratio and efficiency with Varnish, because
 by default two URLs with the same path but different query-strings are also
 different. This is what the RFCs mandate but probably not what you usually
 want for your web site or application.
 A query-string is just a character string starting after a question mark in a
 URL. But in a web context, it is usually a structured key/values store encoded
 with the (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) media type. This module deals
 with this kind of query-strings.
